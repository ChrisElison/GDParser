# GDParser
A simple C# console application to parse Grim Dawn save files and extract character stats/information. Uses code from Grim Dawn Item Assistant by marius00. I hope to add function to render a HTML table showing chracter info or output an XML file.

## Usage
GDParser.exe <filename.gdc>

The program prints out:
* Character name
* Character level
* Character class/mastery
* Hardcore/softcore

To Do:
* Get other character info - money, XP, attributes, devotions, playtime etc
* Add HTML table/XML output generation
